This repository contains the task 1 programs that were developed by our team for the Eyantra competition, conducted by IIT Bombay in 2019. Our team participated in this competition and we developed several programs to solve the challenges posed by the competition.

In this repository, you will find our solutions to the various tasks, as well as the documentation that we created to explain our approach and methodology. We have included all the necessary files and code snippets, so that anyone who is interested in our work can easily understand and replicate our solutions.

Our team worked hard to develop efficient and effective programs that could solve the challenges posed by the competition. We hope that our work will inspire others to explore this fascinating field and continue to push the boundaries of what is possible.
